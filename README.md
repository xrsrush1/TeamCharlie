# TeamCharlie
**Description:**

The objective of this project is to create a VR application based on the theme of ‘Climate Change’. We were a team of 3 to create this. This experience is divided into 3 main scenes developed by each team member. 
The player has to complete the levels to move on to the next one.  The scenes are based on pollution and ways to save it. We have created a gamified experience that will ensure good user interactivity throughout the experience.
