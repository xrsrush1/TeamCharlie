# TeamCharlie: Eco-Warriors
**Description:**

The objective of this project is to create a VR application based on the theme of ‘Climate Change’. We were a team of 3 and our team name is Team Charlie. We decided to name our Project as Eco Warriors. This VR experience is divided into 3 main scenes developed by each team member. 
The player has to complete the levels to move on to the next one.  The scenes are based on pollution and ways to save it. We have created a gamified experience that will ensure good user interactivity throughout the experience. 

The features that are being implemented in this experience are:

**a. Locomotion:** Here, the player can move around in the scene and explore it. This is implemented using the XR toolkit input action managers attached to the controller components.

**b. Grabbable Objects:** Here, the player can interact and pick up and throw around certain objects in the scene. This is implemented using XR Grab Interactable attached to the objects.

**c. VR Slice:** Here, the player can slice through any sliceable objects using the grabbable sword given.
These experiences ensure user interactivity and immersive experience.

**Installation:**

To install the project, simply create a fork of this repository on Git and clone it to your local machine.

**Unity Version:** 

This project is built using Unity version 2022.3.11f1 with a Universal Render Pipeline (URP) setup.
